        <comment>All possible conclusions which can be drawn from a formula.

The object of this function, a formula, is the set of conclusions which can be
drawn from the subject formula, by successively applying any
rules it contains to the data it contains. This is equivalent to
cwm's "--think" command line function.  It does use built-ins, so
it may for example indirectly invoke other documents, validate
signatures, etc.

This is the relation between the antecedent (subject) and

The application of a rule to a knowledge-base is as follows.

gives a formula which is a subset of the knowledge-base,
then the result of applying that same substitution to the
conclusion may be added to the knowledge-base.

(See the CWM manual for command line options to determine how
rules from different sources are applied to and the results
added to various formula.)

        <comment>The log:semantics of a document is the formula.
achieved by parsing representation of the document.
 For a document in Notation3, log:semantics is the
log:parsedAsN3 of the log:contents of the document.
For a document in RDF/XML, it is parsed according to the
RDF/XML specification to yield an RDF formula
(a subclass of N3 log:Formula).

[Aside: Philosophers will be distracted here into worrying about the meaning
of meaning. At least we didn't call this function "meaning"!
In as much as N3 is used as an interlingua for interoperability
for different systems, this for an N3 based system is the meaning 
expressed by a document.]

(Cwm knows how to go get a document and parse N3 and RDF/XML
it in order to evaluate this.
Other languages for web documents 
may be defined whose N3 semantics are therefore
also calculable, and so they could be added in due course.
See for example GRDDL, RDFa, etc)</comment>

(Cwm can get the URI of a resource or get the resource from the URI.)
This is a level breaker, breaking the rule of not looking inside a
URI.   Use (eg with  string:match) to replace RDF's old "aboutEach"
functionality. Use to implement the URI spec and protocol specs, etc.
